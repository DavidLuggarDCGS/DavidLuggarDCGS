I'm just some bloke who travels through time and space in a big blue box labelled police who likes messing around with some stuff and creating a website for a second time seemed like a good way to do it. I also have a docterate in cheese making.

### More Information

I'm the Doctor. I'm a Timelord. I'm from the planet Gallifrey in the constellation of Kasterborous. I'm 903 years old and I'm the man who's gonna save your lives, and all 6 billion people below. You got a problem with that? Good, now listen. People assume that time is a strict progression of cause to effect, but actually, from a non-linear, non-subjective viewpoint, it's more like a big ball of wibbly-wobbly... timey-wimey... stuff. Ok, nevermind that, but know this. The laws of time are mine! AND THEY WILL OBEY ME!
