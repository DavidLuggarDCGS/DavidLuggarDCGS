    <td>Originally, I had already done this. However, after quite a bit of time contemplating, I decided that it wasn't really working and was looking fairly odd. So, I had to revisit the area and look for a new background which worked with the colours I already had, which was being based off of the colours in my icon. As the website had to be read, I searched for a simple background and found one which was white and light grey. I tested it out and thought it worked really well with the blue I was using. I did also manage to work on my tables and made it slightly clearer to read by increasing the space between sections.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Despite it really helping with the look of my blog, I think I spent far too long on it. Even though it is quite important to have a background which makes it far easier to read, I should have been spending time on other aspects. I need to manage my time more carefully when working on my website because otherwise I am not going to get anywhere with it.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I think that next time I will work on managing my time more effectively and working on other aspects of my website such as more complex ideas like a drop down menu. This should allow me to create my website so that it not only looks aesthetically pleasing but is also done efficiently, increasing my time to work on different things in python.</td>
