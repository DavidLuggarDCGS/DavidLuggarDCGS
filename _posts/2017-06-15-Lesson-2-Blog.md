  <tr>
    <td>I learnt by thinking back to previous knowledge and changing certain aspects which made the overall look of it more appealing to the reader, such as using a good colour scheme which is easy to read. As well as this, I have put my blogs into a table which makes reading them far easier.</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I think I spent too much time trying to fiddle around with the colours of the headings and other bits of writing when I could have gone on further to do more complicated things such as changing the format of my tables.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time, I will work on actually focusing on my task instead of getting distracted by changing colours and so on because otherwise I am not going to get far in redesigning my website. I will also ensure that my blogs are uploaded on time so that I don't have to waste lesson time uploading my blogs.</td>
