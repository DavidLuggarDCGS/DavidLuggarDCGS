  <tr>
    <td>I learnt through just remembering previous work I had done and used the simple codes in order to put my basic name checking software together. The most effective strategy was just concentrating on what I was doing and that got me through it quickly. On my github page, just working on little tasks such as the about section helped me add a bit more interest to my page. </td>

  <tr>
    <td>I don't think anything really limited my learning other than the noise in the room from people talking a lot of the time and drawing my concentration away from the task I was meant to be focusing on.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will try and not get distracted as much as I did as it will end up helping me far more because I will be able to work more efficiently on my work and not have to worry about making silly errors in my code. I will also make sure I re-learn some basics in python such as adding variables into a line being printed. On github, I will go over adding background containers to improve the legibility of my website.</td>
