    <td>I didn't learn as such, but instead I experimented with things I already knew. These are things such as colours which work well together and make the blog easily readable. I also experimented with the background, trying out a number of brightly coloured backgrounds as well as dark backgrounds including complex patterns. However, I returned to my original as I found the others were cluttering up the screen, decreasing legibility.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I think the noise in the classroom was distracting me as it was making it harder to concentrate and think about what I was trying to do at certain points. This meant that I was not able to get as far as I would have liked to have gotten. I need to try and avoid distractions as much as possible to create the best website I can.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will focus properly and concentrate more on my work rather than the work of others around me. This should allow me to fully develop my website as much as possible and hopefully provide readers with easy to see text. Afterall, there is no point creating a website if you canâ€™t read it.</td>
