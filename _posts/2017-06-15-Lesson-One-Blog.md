    <td>I found that because I hadn't done much on my GitHub for a while, I was struggling to remember how to do some of the simple things such as changing fonts. I think I need to revisit some of the basics so that I don’t need to worry about the simple things and can focus on further developing my website.</td>

I will try looking up some of the more basic aspects of GitHub so I am not delayed by a lack of knowledge.  </td>
